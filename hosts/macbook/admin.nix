# Permanent admin-group membership for the primary user.
# A root launchd daemon (started at every boot, loops every 120s) that
# re-appends the user to the admin, __appstore and _developer groups if the
# membership was removed (corporate MDM / profile changes can strip it).
# Adapted from hosts/macbook/admin.nix in jagadam97/nixos-config.
#
# NOTE: This grants persistent admin rights. It does NOT make sudo
# passwordless — it keeps macOS's admin-group membership sticky.
